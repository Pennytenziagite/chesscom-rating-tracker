Made by pennytenziagite for coding practice primarily, all you need to run is a Python IDE and the following libraries:
- chessdotcom, available [here](https://pypi.org/project/chess.com/) with docs available [here](https://chesscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- matplotlib.pyplot, available [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) along with documentation.
- numpy

Some further documentation is in the python file, but to choose a user/time control/etc, do so in the settings part of the code.

To do:
- Add image to readme
- Move the settings to an external file
- Check for compatibility with OBS
- Add further customisation options such as background image, fonts, etc
- Add lichess compatibility

Thanks for reading; Enjoy!
